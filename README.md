# IteratedPrisonnersDilemma


In game theory, a prisoner's dilemma is a situation in a game when two players need to bargain and cooperate to achieve the biggest reward - but they might not do so. When the two players refuse to cooperate, even when it is in their best interest, a prisoner's dilemma occurs. The iterated prisoner's dilemma occurs as a result of an extended prisoner's dilemma. When the same players engage in the prisoner's dilemma more than once. In some cases, this type of prisoner's dilemma is called the "Peace-War game."

In this program, I have implemented 14 different strategies that the players can use, the program can then test each strategy against all others in what's called a tournament, and finally displays the result (winning strategy or draw) elegantly in the form of a table.
